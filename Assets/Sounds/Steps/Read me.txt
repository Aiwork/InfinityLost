Basically there are 2 options from here, Stereo or Mono. 
Perfectly, you should code an algorythm that will alternate between left and right step sounds, each time picking a random sound either from left or right
(while keeping the order). If more sounds required for randomness, no problem.

Second option, to conserve time and space, is just fuck it and use the 6 sounds in MONO folder, basically, more random, but doesn't sound like it's alternating between
left or right.

However, if you tell me the engine can automatically mix the steps sound as if it's alternating between right or left, then i'll be making only Monos.
